Input information:

From 2 files:

-Class ex: CSC-110
-Days to be schedueled

2nd File:
-Rooms to scheduele


Example database design
CREATE TABLE Classes(

classID VARCHAR(10)
Days Int

)

Create TABLE Rooms(

RoomNmbr VARCHAR(10)

)


Process:

-Read data from input file "classes"
-> insert into database table 1
-Read data from file "Rooms"
-> insert to database Table 2




where the data starts and how it goes into the database and how it comes out





database design 
-How did you store the information on paper?

if you had to store all the data you had on the paper what would be the most practical way to store data.


if you were taking coffee order for the whole class

Mike small coffee $1.50
joe small coffee $1.50
Keyshawn large coffee $2

size:  price:
small 	1.50

the prices are always the same, you can store orders in one table and keep prices in another table.

redundant information is like price, its redundant, however something like coffee size is tied to our individual orders.



primary key would be section number

using section numbers, you can use primary key section number to then get start and end times. 

data flow diagram


use case diagram does not include time, so nothing is linear in a use case diagram,

use case is an all at once view, its not linear  this is what makes it difference from a data flow diagram.


3 days Database design 

-identify keys elements needed for our database
-



1. Determine the database purpose
1. Discover/collect information
3. Divide entities intos tables
4. Turn Data points into tables
5. Identify Primary Keys and Foreign Key
6. Normalize and Refine!
